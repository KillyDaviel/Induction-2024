          Tsutomu Nihei (弐瓶 勉, Nihei Tsutomu, born February 26, 1971) is a Japanese manga artist. Nihei has been drawing comics professionally since the mid-1990s. In 1995 he was awarded the Jiro Taniguchi Special Prize in that year's Afternoon Four Seasons Award for his submission, Blame. After working as an assistant to veteran comic artist Tsutomu Takahashi, Nihei went on to launch his debut series Blame! in Monthly Afternoon in 1997. Following the success of Blame!, he next penned Wolverine: Snikt! (published by Marvel Comics) and Biomega. In 2009, Nihei returned to Afternoon to launch what would become his most successful series, Knights of Sidonia. An architectural student, Nihei's early work were mainly wordless, relying on visuals and backgrounds to tell their stories. His cyberpunk-influenced artwork has gained a strong cult following worldwide.

          Jarred Pine from <a href="https://www.maniacom.org/">Mania.com</a> commented "[it] is not an easy task" to talk about the story in the first volume as "it leaves quite a gamut of questions open for the reader, nothing on the surface to give the reader a sense of direction or purpose". Pine said Blame! doesn't have a mass appeal and "there will be quite a strong line dividing those who love and hate Nihei's unique and convoluted cyberpunk journey".

            <strong><em>Blame! </em></strong>is a Japanese science fiction manga series written and illustrated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsutomu_Nihei">Tsutomu Nihei</a>. It was published by Kodansha in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinen_manga">seinen manga</a> magazine Monthly Afternoon from 1997 to 2003, with its chapters collected in ten tankōbon volumes. A six-part original net animation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_TAC"> Group TAC</a> was produced in 2003, with a seventh episode included on the DVD release. An anime film adaptation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_Pictures">Polygon Pictures</a> was released as a Netflix original in May 2017.Blame! is set in what is simply known as "The City", a gigantic megastructure now occupying much of what used to be the Solar System. Its exact size is unknown, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsutomu_Nihei">Tsutomu Nihei</a> suggested its diameter to be at least that of Jupiter's orbit, or about 1.6 billion kilometers. In the manga, this is also suggested by Killy crossing an empty, spherical room roughly the size of Jupiter, suggesting that the planet had been there but was disassembled as the City grew.

            By the time of the events of the manga, the City has basically become a series of layered, concentric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_spheres">Dyson spheres</a> filled with haphazard architecture, largely devoid of life. These layers compose the supporting scaffold of the City, known as the Megastructure. The Megastructure is extremely durable, with only a direct blast from a Gravitational Beam Emitter being able to drill through it. In addition, the underside of each Megastructure layer periodically illuminates the overside of the one below to provide a day night cycle. Traveling between layers is generally challenging due to the City's chaotic layout and the dangerous Safeguard response such endeavor may cause, with the means to do so being either climbing stairs for days or taking elevators that reach relativistic speeds. The buildings on each layer are largely uninhabited, although scattered human tribes, rogue Builders, hostile Safeguards, and Silicon Life can be found throughout the entire City.

            As revealed in the prequel <em>NOiSE</em>, the City began as a much smaller structure on Earth, created by humans with the aid of the robotic "Builders". Humanity controlled the Builders through the Netsphere, a hyper-developed version of the Internet accessible only to those with an identificatory genetic marker known as the Net Terminal Gene. Any humans without the gene who attempted to access the Netsphere were exterminated by a special task force known as the Safeguards. Eventually however, a terrorist cult known as "the Order" released a virus that made all humans lose their Net Terminal Genes, thus cutting off their access to the Netsphere and their control over the Builders. Without specific instructions, the Builders began to build chaotically and indefinitely, while the Safeguards' programming degraded into killing all humans without the Net Terminal Gene whether they wanted to access the Netsphere or not.
